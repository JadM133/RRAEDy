# RRAEDy
Main scripts for training Rank Reduction Autoencoders for Dynamical Systems (RRAEDy).

This code is based on the library RRAEs, and it defines config.py that modifies
all models in RRAEs to be used for Dynamical systems.

All files that start by "script_" can be used to train models.

All files that start by "plot_" can be used to post_process results after training is done.
